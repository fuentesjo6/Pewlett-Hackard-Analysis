# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
For this activity we were given a set of tables with data and we were tasked on merging some of the data utilzing pgAdmin 4 to create new tables and help management make an informed decision on the number of employess that will be retiring soon as well as create a new table to show the number of employees eligible for a mentorship within the company.
