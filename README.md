There was also a creation of a new table to show employees that may be ready for a mentorship within the company. To accomplish this I combined 3 tables into one and filtered the data based on employees born between January, 1 1965 and January 31, 1965. The data was filtered to show the most curent empoyees and by employee identification number. You can see more data by clicking on the link below.
